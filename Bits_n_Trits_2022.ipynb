    "### Motivation\n",
    "We often think of events as occurring or not occurring (binary, where 1s or 0s are termed __bits__). If we instead convert to, e.g., severity, and split the categories into three as \"<10%\", \"10-50%\", and \">50%\" or similar, then does this deliver more or less useful (correct) information to the user? The log base determines the name of the information quantum (2 in the case of bits, and 3 for trits), but logarithms of any base can be converted to a more typical base (e.g., 2 or 10)."
