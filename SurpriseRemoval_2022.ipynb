    "## The problem\n",
    "We desire to reduce uncertainty about future events as much as possible. For weather forecasts and related scientific communication to end-users, we aim to minimise forecast error, or maximise our information gain, for predicting hazards. The information required to determine an outcome is determined by the frequency of its occurrence, or its surprisal: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = -\\log_2(f)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is the probability of an event occurring. Herein, we are concerned with a binary probabilistic forecast, where we will mask a time series past a percentile threshold to create a set of Trues and Falses.  Hence with two categories $n=2$, we form an array of probabilities $\\mathbf{f}$ where each sample is denoted by $\\alpha \\in \\{1,2,...,N_\\alpha \\}$. First we consider only one sample, as the following scores are __scoring rules__ and can be applied to any number of samples $N_\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The two categories are $\\mathbf{f} = (1-f,f)$, with each element denoted by $i \\in \\{1,2,...,n\\}$; then average surprise provides a measure of uncertainty in $\\mathbf{f}$ when we summate the possibilities with their probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(f) = \\underbrace{(1-\\mathbf{f}) \\log_2(1-\\mathbf{f})}_{\\textrm{Event did not occur}} + \\underbrace{\\mathbf{f} \\log_2(\\mathbf{f})}_{\\textrm{Event occurred}} \\\\\n",

    "= \\mathsf{E}[S(\\mathbf{f})]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the expectation operator $\\mathsf{E}[~]$ is shorthand for the mean outcome in the limit of time. Above, Shannon entropy $H$, here in bits due to the base-2 logarithm, represents the uncertainty in a time series that must be removed. For comparison, flipping a fair coin resolves *one bit* of uncertainty. Notice that a low value of $H$ but high $S$ occurs when focussing on a given rarer event, because the assumption of \"no event\" is successful more times than not. In meteorology, we can use this score to estimate how much uncertainty is removed by a given forecast by differencing the uncertainty before and after a forecast is obtained. This change in estimated likelihood is measured by the Kullback-Liebler Divergence $D_{\\textrm{KL}}$, which is the uncertainty or surprise (entropy) remaining after a forecast is issued, upon verification from observation $\\mathbf{o} = (1-o,o)$:\n",

    "Variations of this score occur under various names, including Ignorance (ref), the logarithm score (ref), etc. Herein, we implement $D_\\textrm{KL}$ within the Cross-Entropy Score (XES, ref), using cross-entropy $H_\\times$ which extends $D_\\textrm{KL}$ to include observational uncertainty. We also extend to 2-D forecast and observation arrays with $N_\\alpha > 1$:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Brier Score versus Cross-Entropy Score\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces to \"Mean Square Error\" versus \"Cross-Entropy\" as measures of distances between the forecast and observation probability distributions. Perhaps due to the computational resources required to compute logarithms (Harold Brooks, pers. corr.), the mean squared error or __Brier Score__ is (ref) often used in meteorology:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{BS} = \\frac{1}{N_\\alpha} \\sum_\\alpha^{N_\\alpha}  (\\mathbf{f}-\\mathbf{o})^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the XES in one-term form (i.e., not DKL) for two events (say, rain or no-rain) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textrm{XES} = o \\log_2 f - (1-o) \\log_2 (1-f) \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for forecasts of rare events (<10\\%), the Brier Score deviates substantially from the \"true\" measure of information gained. Benedetti (2010) showed that BS was a second-order approximation of XES (cf. above with their eqs. 27--31), where the biggest differences between the two scores occurred at extreme probabilities (near zero and unity). As in Benedetti, we can show this mathematically by first expanding the Brier Score for one event, with for forecast and observed probabilities $f$ and $o$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate the scenarios where largest differences occur between BS and XES practically by comparing the scores, first normalising each score by a measure of uncertainty so we can compare like-for-like __skill scores__. (This is shown mathematically below the figure). Skill scores are preferred over the un-normalised score, as they are independent of the observational uncertainty $H(\\mathbf{o})$. We plot BSS and XESS for $f \\in [0.01,0.99]$ when the observed frequency $o \\in \\{0.1,0.3,0.5\\}$. __Forecast probabilities must be bounded to minimum and maximum probabilities__ $[ \\underline{p},\\bar{p} ]$ to avoid divergence to infinity, but also to avoid full confidence in the face of underdispersion (overfitting). We also set $\\log_2 0 = 0$. A positive value indicates better skill than climatology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quote from Wikipedia regarding Benedetti paper: \"The Brier score becomes inadequate for very rare (or very frequent) events, because it does not sufficiently discriminate between small changes in forecast that are significant for rare events. Wilks (2010) has found that \"...quite large sample sizes, i.e. n > 1000, are required for higher-skill forecasts of relatively rare events, whereas only quite modest sample sizes are needed for low-skill forecasts of common events.\"\n"

For rare and impactful events, the event itself may contribute very little to values averaged over a long time. This can be considered by attributing larger value to the most impactful events (i.e., where the event was observed; this mimicks societal preference for false alarms over missed hits). Here is an information-theoretical analogue of the 2x2 contingency table (confusion matrix) developed by (Green and Swets), where each box indicates the gain or loss of information in terms of surprise. We convert the probabilistic forecast into binary by setting $o$ to True if greater than 0.5, and False otherwise; a forecast is True if $f$ is greater than the end-user's critical probability $p_\\textrm{cric}$, above which the user takes action such as damage mitigation:\n",

    "Insufficiently accurate initial conditions, and erroneous models, mean that we will waste resources past a quantisation (resolution) level where observational error becomes substantial. This is the curse of dimensionality. Probability space is also insufficiently sampled: there will always be regions of phase space not explored by the EFS, plus an operational model is not perfect. (Herein, we use a perfect L63 model, but perturbations can be added during the integration to simulate model-error drift.) Further, smaller spatial and time scales require more information to determine its state. Hence, at finer spatial resolutions (which come with finer temporal resolutions due to the CFL criterion), more members are required to capture the larger information dimension of the pdf, or a kernel dressing should be applied to interpolate the pdf between members (refs). \n",

    "We use the z-component (in L63, this represents rising motion in convective cells) as our time series. We convert to a binary forecast by identifying where the time series exceeds the given percentile. We then quantise in time to both introduce tolerance and mimic EFS real-world output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The parameter $\\rho$ controls the intermittency (burstiness), which through chaotic growth (see Lyapunov exponents) destroys information about the state of the system until no further information can be obtained. This asymptote is an analogue of Lorenz's predictability limit after error saturation.\n",
    "* Window size $w$ mimicks the time- and spatial-scale-aware quantisation methods used by verification scores such as Fractions Skill Score (refs). Within each overlapping window segment, moved to centre on each data point from the raw time series, we assign True for that $\\alpha$ if the percentile is exceeded for that member or observation; False otherwise. This avoids verifying the noisy sample-by-sample evaluation, which is analgous to evaluating a weather model at the truncated scale (i.e., gridpoint-to-gridpoint). It also reflects the tolerance for false alarms over missed hits. The larger the value of $w$, the more likely a forecast captures the event, but the less information is transferred about the precise time of occurrence when interpreted in real-time $\\tau$. Hence we may expect an optimised sweet-spot.\n",
    "* The larger the percentile, the rarer the event. Coupled with the variation in regime via $\\rho$, this generally represents the forecast challenge of rare, intermittent (bursty) events such as supercell outbreaks.\n",
    "* We run 200 ensemble members ($N_e = 200$), but subsample randomly to create smaller ensembles of various sizes. This will assess the benefit of increasing the required computer resources linearly despite diminishing returns: each additional member contains more mutual information with the rest of the EFS members, meaning increasingly less novel (correct) information is acquired), and increasingly more incorrect information. Hence we may expect a sweet-spot.\n",
    "* We perturb initial conditions with a range of small perturbations from a uniform distribution to reflect initial condition uncertainty. As these perturbvations increase in magnitude, predictability is lost more quickly (information gain cumulates over time logarithmically). However, no perturbations at all would defeat the purpose of an EFS. Hence, we expect another sweet-spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high number of permutations of the above parameters mean we aggregate over all other parameters for each given parameters: this is not rigorous but will show the variability of information gain (and BSS versus XESS) as a function of $\\rho$, $w$, percetile, and $N_e$."

This is seen in RELSS, and hence is independent of inherent uncertainty (UNC), and suggests the calibration error is a function of the flow. The lowest REL error occurs at smaller window sizes, though the $\\rho = 166.08$ and $= 166.09$ regimes show a minimum near 50 and 100 unit times, respectively. This is analgous to identifying the smallest skillful scale: evaluating data without time--space tolerance will appear poor due to a multitude of phase errors. The variation of optimal window size with regime reiterates the need to evaluate on numerous time--space scales.\n",

    "Comparing BSS and XESS, we see that XESS is more sensitive to poor probabilities than BSS for a small number of ensemble members. The two scores are similar for evaluating skill with respect to IC error and window size. But at extreme percentiles (d), the XESS punishes poor forecasts more severely in the top percentile. It is this non-negligible discrepancy, coupled with the mathematical support of information theory, that supports use of XES and XESS especially in applications where high value is placed on useful information about rare events (i.e., usually high-impact hazards). For instance, forecasting extreme events such as extreme percentile values for rotating supercells may be more accurately evaluated with information theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, information gain is the difference between prior (naïve) and posterior uncertainty. The prior uncertainty may simply be UNC; alternatively, we discuss how a prior estimate of uncertainty can be computed from a time series to form a rate of information loss (Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy or $H_\\mu$; ref). Hence, we can form an information \"stream\" from naivity to the end-user's decision, whereby the EFS, human forecasters, emergency managers, etc represent \"information dams\". At each dam, the goal is to reduce uncertainty and maximise information gain. The components can be conserved throughout the flow of information."
